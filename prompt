Create a portfolio website for an artist painter.

Categories and functionality:
1. A landing page with a large image
2. On the top right, three main categories: About, Work (further divided ()hover-over dropdown) into two subcategories: drawings, paintings), Blog
3. The work category should show thumbnails of pictures that can be expanded by clicking on them. The thumbnails are shown in a continous band so that horizontals and verticals always align. When clicked on a large version of the picture is shown with sub-information: Title, Year, Material shown on the bottom left. Clicking the right part of the picture goes to the next picture and the left part to the previous picture.
4. Make the design mobile friendly


Layout:
- minimalistic (white background)
- modern design
